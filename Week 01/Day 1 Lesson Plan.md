## 2.1 Lesson Plan - Definition and Ideation

---

### Overview

Today's class will introduce students to the fundamentals of the definition phase of the Design Thinking process. Students will practice synthesis and definition and use a user persona to generate user insights and brainstorm problem statements.

---

### Class Objectives

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

- Write user insight statements.

- Write how might we statements.

- Build problem statements.

---

### Instructor Notes

- Today's class is about the definition phase of the Design process. It is divided up into three parts. In Part One, we'll talk about user personas. In Part Two, we'll cover user insights. In Part Three, students will learn how to build problem statements.

- During the affinity diagram and user personas activities, students should be using the interview data they collected from Unit 1 Homework.

  - **Important:** If students completed homework 1 (user persona or empathy map), they should be encouraged to use that deliverable during today's workshop.

- By the end of today's class, students should have a grasp of how to move between the various research phases: empathy, definition, and ideation. They should understand how to use user personas to create user insights and problem statements.

- Extra time should be spent reviewing students' problem statements. Problem statements are the starting place for ideation. They will use these statements as the basis for their mobile app case study.

- Keep track of the clock. Have TAs consult the TimeTracker: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12zdN_8slPfL00L_leqTz11yM431XP-s4nrpUrLzmRQI/edit#gid=1086546131

### Office Hours: Daily UI (45 mins before class) (Office Hours) 

> Note: Encourage your students to make the most out of class, and to not be afraid to ask questions.

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome, Class Objectives + Introduce Homework (5 min)

Welcome students to class and open the slides for the day: https://drive.google.com/open?id=11l6DkGcA-NmCdlQ4zcsTchSLkP-mSUOf0-j24QRmSlE

First let's introduce today's objectives to the class:

By the end of class today, students will be able to:

- Synthesize research using affinity diagrams and user personas.

- Generate user insights.

- Build problem statements.

Now let's introduce the homework so students can start to think about it:

- Open the homework in front of the class - [Week 2 Homework File](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12M9HK5Xt-0sBQPBWejF1XW9BQhE1NGjlLLf6Laq6k4U)
- Read through the instructions with the class.
- When you are finished, ask the class if anyone has any questions.
- Make sure you make/download a copy to share with your class!

## 2. Instructor Do: User Personas & User Insights (15 min)

In today's class, we will learn how to develop more empathy for a user persona.

**Definition Phase** Is where designers synthesize observations about their users from the first stage. The goal of this phase is to define a problem statement. A problem statement will kick start the ideation process.

**Analysis** is about breaking down complex concepts and problems into smaller, easier-to-understand constituents. We do that, for instance, during the first stage of the Design Thinking process, the Empathise stage, when we observe and document details that relate to our users. 

**Synthesis**, on the other hand, involves creatively piecing the puzzle together to form whole ideas. This happens during the Define stage when we organise, interpret, and make sense of the data we have gathered to create a problem statement.

One way we can dive deeper into a user persona is through user insights.

**User insights** are the end goal of research. When done well, they are meaningful to design teams, businesses, and finding solutions that are meaningful to your users.

User Insights:

  - Identify unmet needs.

  - Validate ideas.

  - Unlock strategic innovations.

Great Research Insights are:

  - Grounded in real data and research.

  - Simple in language and concept.

  - Meaningful and memorable.

  - Speak to your audience.

  - Inspire clear, direct action.

Tips for Building Great User Insights:

TIP 1: Share Relevant Insight.

- For example: Say 8 out of 10 people surveyed were unhappy with the restaurant options they found near their hotel.

- During user interviews, we heard participants mention their preference for staying with family if possible [when traveling] because “having a kitchen or washing machine makes it so much simpler while I’m away from home.”

TIP 2: Explain the conclusion you’ve come to based on the insight.

- For example: Users might have a more pleasant experience while traveling if they could manage to feel “at home” anywhere.

TIP 3: Articulate the design concept by revealing your actual idea in a few sentences.

- For example: We could find a way to connect people who travel with locals who are willing to rent out their apartment or home for a while. That way, while traveling, people can feel at home ANYWHERE.

TIP 4: Communicate how the concept will be conveyed in the project or design you’re creating.

- For example: We might use a format for finding a home to rent that is similar to how users might book a flight or hotel.

- And host homes can be anything! An entire house, RV, or treehouse.

TIP 5: Reveal the reason why you’re executing the project.

- For example: We think this might be the next new thing in travel and hospitality!

- We want to inspire people to travel, and we want individuals to be able to earn money while opening their homes to others!

- Voila, we've invented Airbnb!

## 3. Student Do: User Insight Activity (10 min)

It's time to create a user insight.

Slack students the following link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1burwiogpUtLYQsNVxK_SipvALl2nLSfQOHJbxaOPaL8/edit

    ![Insight Template](Images/PoV-Template-2.png)

## 6. Instructor Do: Review (15 min)

Call attention back to the front of the class and hold critique.

- Remind the students to post their user insight in Slack.

- Choose a file from Slack and open it.

Ask the student:

- Can you walk me through your process?

Ask a student from a different group:

- What is one thing you like about this insight?

- What is one thing you would do differently?

Ask a TA:

- What is one thing you like about this insight?

- What is one thing you would do differently?

Provide your feedback:

- What is one thing you like about this insight?

- What is one thing you would do differently?

If you have time, choose another file from slack and repeat the critique process.

## 7. Instructor Do: How Might We Statements (10 min)

How might we questions are short questions that launch brainstorms.

These short questions are generated before creating a problem statement and are broad enough for a wide range of solutions but narrow enough that the team has boundaries for their ideas.

How Might We Statements are used to break up your problem statement into smaller, actionable pieces. These pieces can be aspects of the larger problem or they can be challenges that are specific to a certain group of people that should be considered when creating a product or service for that group of people.

For example, consider the following problem statement:

1. We believe that Anya Cho wants to help needy people in her community, but finds it hard to connect to like-minded individuals who might help her tackle the needs of vulnerable people. By introducing a platform that lets people in need post a daily cause, we may help her solve this problem by helping her network with other people who want to help volunteer in the local community.

**This could lead to the following How Might We questions**

  - How might we increase quality of life in local communities?
  - How might we connect like-minded individuals in a community to one another?
  - How might we determine what poor people in our communities need?
  - How might we help social activists to promote their community outreach online?

Let's take a look at another example. Consider the following problem statement:

2. We believe that Angelina Lopez has trouble saving money to send her kids to college, due to having a large family and low pay. We believe that by introducing a way for Angelina Lopez to track how much she is saving each month for each of her children's individual tuitions, we may solve this problem by providing the peace of mind that comes with knowing exactly when each goal will be met.

**This could lead to the following How Might We questions**

  - How might we track individual goals concurrently?
  - How might we give peace of mind to busy parents or goal-oriented people?
  - How might we help blue-collar families with limited finances plan for their futures?
  - How might we give a clear timeline for a specific goal to be met?

## 8. Student Do: How Might We Activity (10 min)

In this activity, students will define a how might we statement for their user persona.

Slack out the activity instructions: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16iVXciRZofSCtQlxLcgudrW-OEtX9WODZqLrv4ZG3ZM/edit?usp=sharing

Set a timer for 10 minutes.

## 9. Instructor Do: How Might We Review (5 min)

To test for student competency, ask the class the following questions:
1. What purpose do How Might We Statements have for UX researchers?
2. Are How Might We Statements focused or broad?
3. Why are How Might We Statements generated from problem statements?

## 10. Break (15 min)

Have a nice break!

## 11. Instructor Do: How to Build A Problem Statement (15 min)

The ability to write and present a solid problem statement is an indispensable skill to have as a designer, because UX helps define problems and verbalize opportunities to stakeholders in the business.

Problem Statements:

  - Are created at the very beginning of a project (definition phase).

  - Describe a problem that needs to be addressed.

  - State a vision and methods that will help solve the problem.

  - Are meant to be shared, so they should be concise and crystal clear.

A Good Problem Statement Should...

- Focus in on a problem: Laser focused 1-2 sentences, 3-4 sentences max.

- Provide context: Describe what the problem is, rather than how to solve it. (Pizza vs, Pizza dropped on the street) 

- Define a clear outcome or solution: What KPI / emotion are you hoping this problem statement improves?

- Be aware of business constraints: The real world dictates businesses need to make money. How much runway a team has to work on a problem is part of the business constraints.

- A Problem Statement Does Not...

  - Provide a solution.

  - Assign blame.

  - Get too large.

  - Address multiple problems.

How to Write a Problem Statement:

1. Create an empathy map or user persona (we did that).

2. Ask "How Might We" Questions.

   - How-Might-We questions are a way to frame your ideation and often used for launching brainstorms.

   - Note how problem statements should be phrased as a question.

   - It should be actionable. Use active verbs to describe intent.

   - They Question assumptions.

   - Review the example.

3. Use a User painpoint to frame your statement.

    - You articulate a Problem Statement by combining three elements – user, need, and insight.

    - Review the example.

4. Choose a Single Problem to Focus on.

    - Many problems will be uncovered, some more interesting or critical than others.

    - Ask yourself Five Why's to get to the real root of the problem.

Problem Statement Example:

Let's say we have observed that Airbnb isn’t giving rental owners enough money. As a result, renters are using a different service.

Our problem statement might look like:

  - How might we improve Airbnb's booking process so that our customers are successful based on an increase in quarterly revenue, improved booking, and return visits to using the Airbnb app.

  - Review the example.

## 12. Everyone Do: Adobe XD Demo (10 min)

In just a minute you will practice writing problem statements using Adobe XD. But first, it's time for a short demo of Adobe XD.

Here are the main components of Adobe XD...

- **The interface:**

  - When you launch Adobe XD, a “start window” will pop up.

  - Here you can choose the size of your artboard.

  - The artboard represents the screen of the app or the page of the website you are going to design.

  - Once you choose an artboard to work with, you will see the main XD workspace.

  ![Adobe XD](Images/Adobe-XD-01.jpg).

- **The Menu Bar:**

  - At the very top of the screen we have the classic Mac OS or Windows menu bar.

  - You can explore and use all of these options from this menu.

  ![Adobe XD](Images/Adobe-XD-02.png).

- **The Top Horizontal Panel:**

  - On the left, we have the “Design / Prototype” switch (1).

  - When you are in Design mode you can make all those changes impacting the visual side of your project.

  - On the right side, we can find the zoom dropdown menu (2), which I personally never use as we already have a zoom tool on the left side of the screen (which works great).

  - The little phone icon next to it (3) allows you to preview your project on your mobile device by using the Adobe XD app, available for both iOS and Android.

  - We have a little play icon (4) which allows you to preview your project directly on your computer.

  - And finally, we have a share icon (5), allowing you to share your prototype with your clients, team members

  ![Adobe XD](Images/Adobe-XD-03.png).

- **The Left Toolbar:**

  - Here we have all the main tools available in Adobe XD.

  - Learn the shortcuts by heart as soon as possible. You will use most of these tools all the time, and the shortcuts will greatly speed up your workflow.  

  - Review the shortcut image.

  ![Adobe XD](Images/Adobe-XD-04.png).

- **The Right-Hand Panel:**

  - In this panel you can find several settings allowing you to view or change the properties of your objects:

  - Review the image

  ![Adobe XD](Images/Adobe-XD-05.png).

We need to learn to get comfortable using Adobe XD because next week we will be using it to prototype!

## 13. Student Do: Problem Statement Activity (15 min)

>Note: You can find instructor-facing guidance and insight for this activity here: (https://docs.google.com/document/d/19sIkbsYmSBnVa2psCElyNSV3OW-NRUqkup2p_SkQ8Is/edit#heading=h.wj8ojly88pl6)

Wow. We've made a lot of progress. We know who our user is but we don't yet know what problem to solve. We will execute our problem statements using Adobe XD.

Slack students the following link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1burwiogpUtLYQsNVxK_SipvALl2nLSfQOHJbxaOPaL8

Instructions:

- To begin, form a group of two with a classmate, and set the timer for 5 minutes.

- Download the UX [Problem Statement Template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZrwF581Xaq2Rra2tJLJBQdE6H73NYZ6g).

- Pick your user persona to begin.

- Fill out the Madlib template with your partner.

- Switch and repeat.

- Export your problem statement as .PNG file.

## 14. Student Do: Peer Review (10 min)

Call the class back to attention. Have the students share their problem statement with a classmate.

Instructions:

1. Distribute and iterate: Share your storyboard with one of your classmates.

2. As a reviewer, read the problem statement and ask yourself:

   - Does the statement define a clear problem and solution?

3. As a reviewer, provide feedback using the format:

   - I think this is a compelling problem statement because... (note 1-2 things you like).
   - I think you could improve... (note 1-2 things you think could be improved).

4. Take a photo of your work.

## 15. Student Do: Problem Statement Iteration (10 min)

Call the class back to attention.

Slack students the following link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=18QVjN3JcDO4RNG_p6bBbxbjzGk8644BHgXKA0_valPI

We're doing the second part of the same document.

- Look over your feedback and iterate your statement.

  - Ask yourself: How can I improve my statement based off the feedback I received.

- Export your problem statement as .PNG file.

## 16. Instructor Do: Review (15 min)

Call attention back to the front of the class. Make the point that the class practiced defining problems themselves but that these statements are best made with *clients* and *stakeholders*.

Hold critique.

- Remind the students to post their problem statements in Slack.

- Choose a file from Slack and open it.

Ask the student:

- Can you walk me through your process?

Provide your feedback:

- What is one thing you like about this statement?

- What is one thing you would do differently?

Try and give as much feedback on problem statement as possible.

Choose another file from Slack and repeat the critique process several times. Emphasize the importance of problem statement. Encourage students to stay for office hours to get feedback if they didn't during critique.

### 17. Instructor Do: Recap + End Class (2 mins)

We did it! You did it!

Remember office hours are for the next 30 minutes after class.

Wish everyone a good night and take questions.

### 18. Instructor Do: Office Hours (30 mins)

Hold office hours and help your class out with whatever problems they may have.
