## 2.3 UX Storytelling

### Overview

In today's class, students will continue to build on their ideation fundamentals established in the last class. Students will explore methods for brainstorming features for their mobile apps, and then cover elements of storytelling. Students will practice storytelling by creating user scenarios, storyboards, and a user journey map.

### Class Objectives

By the end of today's class, students will be able to:

- Put ideation and brainstorming into practice with the "What if, I Like, I Wish" method.

- Use a feature prioritization matrix to practice prioritizing features.

- Create a user scenario and use it to sketch a storyboard.

- Build a user journey map.

### Instructor Notes

- Today's class is about storytelling. It is divided into three parts. In Part 1, we'll talk about storytelling, and students will practice generating ideas for their mobile app case study. In Part 2, we will discuss and create user scenarios and storyboards. In Part 3, we will discuss and create user journey maps.

- Students will cover ideation, brainstorming, and storytelling concepts from the ideation phase of the design process. They will use their familiarity with these concepts to execute the in-class activities.

- Students will need to use the user persona they created in the Unit 1 homework or during class today. They will be brainstorming app ideas during an ideation activity.

- Make sure your students know that the work they complete today in class will be needed for the activities scheduled for the next lecture. The knowledge and skills covered today will be built on in future classes.

- Lastly, keep track of the clock. Have TAs consult the Time Tracker: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BU_UmY_-tNT61p85T9n9EZjWZwBD0ldRDYXcntL1zYM/edit?usp=sharing

### Office Hours: Daily UI (Slides 1–3) (45 mins before class)

**Note:** Encourage students to utilize the time provided and to not be afraid to ask questions.

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome + Objectives (5 min)

Welcome students to class and open Storytelling Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1e-4kSUY0NMsAENL7mfAKiVJy1F3pTecEpDWH43q9CO0/edit#slide=id.g480f0dd0a7_0_1809

## 2. Instructor Do: Storytelling & User Scenario (10 min)

Storytelling and UX:

- As we try to design new experiences, there is a lot we can learn from storytelling.

- In user experience design, we invent things people have never experienced before.

- People share experiences through stories.

- The ability to tell a compelling story about your design that conveys its value is an important skill.

Elements of Storytelling:

- Main character (hero):

  - Remember that your user is the hero.

  - Your product (or service/brand) is not the hero.

- Setting:

  - Where this story takes place.

  - It describes the situation of the user.

- A conflict:

  - UX design is all about solving problems for your user.

  - Therefore, you need to have a solid understanding of your user's pain points (problems or conflicts).

- Resolution:

  - How does your product solve the user's problems?

  - What does the main character feeling after using your product?

User Scenarios:

- **User scenarios** are short stories that clearly define how a user interacts with a product or service.

  - They have three main components: persona, scenario, and goal(s).

  - The _persona_ defines who the story is about.

  - The _goal_ defines what the persona wants.

  - The _scenario_ defines the when, where, and how.

    ![Scenario Template](Images/03-UXStoryboarding_ScenarioBuilding.png)

Why Do I Need User Scenarios?

  - It is important not only to get to know the actual users, but also to understand the goals these users have.

  - We can only define design requirements to meet these goals when we know who does what on our website, and how and why they do it.

When Do I Need User Scenarios?

  - You need user scenarios whenever you design any kind of user interface.

  - So, pretty much always.

Review the examples and point out that: *A good user scenario is short, relevant, and to the point.*

  - It answers the following questions:

    - Who is the user I’m designing for?

    - What does this user want on my site or app?

    - How is this user going to achieve his or her goals?

    - Why does this user come to my site and not anywhere else?

How to Write a user scenario:

- Walk through the steps for creating a user scenario.

- We will be creating a scenario using the template in the upcoming activity.

## 3. Student Do: User Scenario Activity (15 min)

It's time for students to practice writing a user scenario for their mobile apps.

Students should focus on the most high-impact, high-priority features identified during the feature matrix activity.

By now, students should have identified an area of interest. The goal is to get students to think through how to solve that problem.

Slack students the following file:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VKDeCYRlqhjtCfAqORssAHalTPByyjV401C-tHnKFII/edit?usp=sharing

Instructions:

1. On a piece of paper, draw the scenario template. You can also  download the [scenario template](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1X2l2c6Gte0IO6Mbvl3aZqXrnTX1nVWtz).

2. Write a scenario for one of your idea areas.

   - Identify your user.

   - Define the user's goal(s).

   - List the potential motivations the user might have for taking action.

   - List the actions of the user by establishing when, where, and how the user will accomplish their goal(s).

   - Define the steps the user must take to accomplish the goal(s).

   - Identify how the user feels during each step they take to reach their goal.

## 4. Student Do: Peer Review (10 min)

Get students' attention and let them know time is up. Tell students to share their scenario with a classmate and follow these steps:

Instructions:

- Read your classmate's scenario and answer the following questions:

  - Does the scenario include the character and the setting?

  - Does the scenario define a clear goal?

  - Is it a compelling story?

- Provide feedback using the following format:

  - Note 1 or 2 things you like: _I think this is a compelling story because..._

  - Note 1 or 2 things that could be improved: _I think you could improve..._

## 5. Student Do: User Scenario Iteration (10 min)

Students should take 10 minutes to iterate their user scenario.

## 6. Instructor Do: User Scenario Review (15 min)

When time is up, call on students to share their scenarios.

- Ask a student: Does the scenario have a compelling story?

  - Ask another student: Does the story have a persona, goal, and setting?

  - Have that student call on a different student to share their work.

Spend the remaining time of this review emphasizing the importance of user scenarios.

- If applicable, explain why and how you have used scenarios in any previous jobs.

- Ask your TAs if they have any experience to share about storyboards.

## 7. Instructor Do: Storyboards (10 min)

UX and Storyboards:

- In order to make our product better, we must understand what’s going on in our user's world and how our product can make their lives better. This is where storyboards come in.

- **Storyboards** are illustrations that visually predict and explore a user's experience with a product.

- Like User Scenarios, storyboards are another tool to help us empathize with our users.

- This method originated in Hollywood.

Storyboards:

- Are a low-fidelity artifact.

- Are useful for when you work with stakeholders such as execs, product, marketing, engineering, or sales.

- Are a powerful tool because they are:

  - Visual: Pictures are worth a thousand words.

  - Memorable: We remember stories much more than facts. (Ever watch the news?)

  - Empathic and engaging: As consumers, we empathize when we imagine ourselves in the shoes of a character.

How to Sketch a Storyboard:

  1. Choose a persona and scenario.

  2. Plan out the panels.

     - Think through the steps you want to draw out.

     - Using your user scenario, try to identify 5-6 steps your user would take as they interact with your product.

  3. Add visuals.

     - Happy or sad faces can help inform your storyboard sketches.

     - Stick figures are just fine for illustrations.

  4. Distribute and iterate.

## 8. Student Do: Storyboard Activity (20 min)

It's time for students to practice sketching a storyboard for their user scenario.

Slack students the following file and read through the instructions with them:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/186drfihPtx-2QVDSk2qu58op7GpUjkGcNuaBKxzbrHg/edit?usp=sharing

Instructions:

You will need paper, markers, and your persona and user scenario for this activity.

1. Write out the steps of the scenario. Try to include the following elements:

   - Beginning.
   - Rising action.
   - Climax.
   - Falling action.
   - Resolution.

2. Add a happy or sad face to each written step to indicate the emotion associated with each visual.

3. Sketch visuals for each step in the process.

   **Note:** Stick figures make for great early storyboard frames.

4. You should have 5 frames. The frames should include:
   - Your user (persona/character).
   - The context (mobile app).
   - The location (inside, outside, etc.).

5. Take a photo of your work.

## 12. Instructor Do: Storyboard Review (10 min)

Call the class back to attention.

- Call on a student to share their experience creating the storyboard.

- Ask a student one of the following questions:

  - When they reviewed a storyboard, was the story compelling? Why?

  - Did providing feedback help you think critically about your own work? Why?

- Spend the remaining time of this review emphasizing the importance of constructive feedback.

  - If applicable, explain why and how you have used storyboards in any previous jobs.

  - Ask your TAs if they have an experience to share about storyboards.

## 13. Instructor Do: Customer Journey Map (10 min)

Journey Mapping:

- A widely used tool that combines storytelling and visualization.

  - Visualizes the flow and feelings that users experience as they use a product.

  - Describes a sequence of events, such as purchasing behavior or taking a trip.

Why Use a Customer Journey Map?

- To understand what motivates your customers or users: their needs, hesitations, and concerns.

  - To identify friction and pain points.

5 Main Parts of a Journey Map:

1. The User.

   - Describes who the journey is about.

2. The Scenario.

   - Determines the specific experience to map.

   - Clarifies the user’s goal during this experience.

3. Actions, Mindsets, and Emotions.

   - The heart of the map.

   - Describes what the user is doing, thinking, and feeling during the journey.

   - Usually based on qualitative research.

4. Touchpoints and Channels.

   - Aligns touchpoints and channels with user goals and actions

     - Touchpoints: Times when the user actually interacts with the product

     - Channels: Methods of communication or service delivery, such as the mobile app

5. Insights and Ownership

   - The entire point of the journey-mapping process is to uncover gaps in the user experience.

   - Then we fill those gaps!

   - This is how we slowly turn someone into a long-term, loyal customer.

Review the Journey Map Examples.

## 14. Student Do: User Journey Map Activity (25 min)
