## 2.2 UX/Design Thinking + Ideation

### Overview

In today's class, students will learn about the ideation phase of the design process and the business side of user experience.

### Class Objectives

By the end of today's class, students will be able to:

- Put ideation and brainstorming into practice with the "What if, I Like, I Wish" method.

- Use a feature prioritization matrix to practice prioritizing features.

- Create a competitor analysis.

- Define a value proposition statement. 

### Instructor Notes

- Today's class is about storytelling. It is divided into three parts. In Part 1, we'll talk about storytelling, and students will practice generating ideas for their mobile app case study. In Part 2, we will discuss and create user scenarios and storyboards. In Part 3, we will discuss and create user journey maps.

- Students will cover ideation, brainstorming, and storytelling concepts from the ideation phase of the design process. They will use their familiarity with these concepts to execute the in-class activities.

- Students will need to use the user persona they created in the Unit 1 homework or during class today. They will be brainstorming app ideas during an ideation activity.

- Make sure your students know that the work they complete today in class will be needed for the activities scheduled for the next lecture. The knowledge and skills covered today will be built on in future classes.

- Lastly, keep track of the clock. Have TAs consult the Time Tracker: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dgOaEIy2jsjsTXGGJ_YTABmAdS8AkGvFLN_DDIu2maQ/edit?usp=sharing

- [Class Video:](https://codingbootcamp.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=7e6d3453-65ad-4a5a-b6d2-aa560173009c) Watch a sample video of this class being taught by Hannah Patellis.

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome, Ideation & Brainstorming (10 min)

Welcome students to class and open today's: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tf41FNiEFwADDUU8v4fPd2S-2GqcuW8wP9oHnk0_cyk/edit

The Ideation Phase is the third step in the design cycle. It is the process of generating, developing, and communicating new ideas. Our goal is to spark ideas — in the form of questions and solutions — through creative and curious activities.

So how do we brainstorm? Well, IDEO - a famous design company - pioneered some basic rules.

IDEO Rules of Brainstorming:

- Start with a problem statement: Identify the core subject or the main aim of the exercise.

  - Encourage wild ideas & defer judgement!: There are NO bad ideas at this point. Even if an idea doesn’t seem realistic, it may spark another idea.

  - Build on the ideas of others: Think “and” rather than “but”.

  - Stay focused on a topic: Brainstorming is focused work, so keep your users’ problems in sight.

  - One conversation at a time: All ideas need to be heard so they can be built upon each other.

  - Be visual: Draw your ideas, as opposed to just writing them down, complete with stick figures, simple sketching and words to help convey your ideas.

  - Go for quantity!: Good ideas to have lots and lots of ideas to choose from.

Today we will use ideation to brainstorm features for our mobile apps. We will use the **I Like, I Wish, What If** method to brainstorm.

I Like, I Wish, What If Method:

- This is a simple and extremely useful method to structure feedback.

- This format can be used by teams of two or as many as 100 people.

- _I Like_ statements convey positive feedback.

  - Example: I like that Airbnb shows me reviews based off of communication

- _I Wish_ statements convey negative feedback.

  - Example: I wish that Airbnb could show you a virtual tour.

- _What If_ statements talk about the distant future.

  - Example: What if Airbnb had a chat client so I could easily talk to hosts?

- Feedback is best given with "I" statements. This method creates positive communication because it reframes statements from something negative to something positive.

  - Example: “I sometimes feel you don’t listen to me” instead of “You don’t listen to a word I say.”

  - Also, saying "I wish" is more positive than saying "I don't like."

## 2. Instructor Do: I Like, I Wish, What If Activity Demo (10 min)

Say: **Let's practice this method by brainstorming for Airbnb.**

Instructions:

1. Have a TA go to the whiteboard.

2. Call on 5 students to get 3 I Like ideas. Have the TA write them on the board.

3. Call on 5 students to get 3 I Wish ideas. Have the TA write them on the board.

4. Call on 5 students to get 3 What If ideas. Have the TA write them on the board.

5. Have the TAs vote on their favorite ideas.

## 3. Student Do: I Like, I Wish, What If Activity (30 min)

> Note: You can find instructor-facing guidance and insight for this activity here: (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nqqFBiHBSfR8Mn7ysDx3TXXC_FKIgFBeziNXcgZBlnE/edit#heading=h.wj8ojly88pl6)

While in the real world you can spend a day or more ideating, today's activity will be a lightning round in ideation!

Slack out the following file to students:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1owjh-RWRTjIw4P1qd0D97sxHnn4KQEuDeiZAk_RZj1A/edit?usp=sharing

Instructions:

1. Gather your artifacts and create a new board.

   - You will need your design brief, user persona, user insight, and problem statement.
   - In your browser, go to [Realtimeboard.com](https://realtimeboard.com/pricing/).
   - Give your board a name, e.g., Ideation.

2. For each category, set a timer for 5 mins and start creating statements on sticky notes in your board.

    - I Like
      - Hint! Positive statements.
    - I Wish
      - Hint! Negative statements.
    - What If
      - Hint! Possible solutions.

    **Note:** Jot down every idea you have. There is no such thing as a bad idea!

3. It's time to review and look for similarities and patterns.

   - Look at your three categories of ideas.
   - Start moving the sticky notes around and clustering similar ideas.

4. Draw a circle around each cluster, and give each one a title using a different colored sticky note.

5. Take a photo of your work.

### 4. Instructor Do: Ideation Review (5 mins)

Get students' attention and let them know time is up. Review the activity by asking some of the following questions:

- Who came up with 5 ideas?

- Who came up with 10 ideas?

- Who came up with more than 20 ideas? 

- How would you choose the idea you want to build first?

- How would you choose the second idea you want to build?

- How do you think designers choose ideas?

Ask a final question:

- Who has heard of feature prioritization?

Instruct the class to:

- Show you a fist if they have no idea.

- Show you a high five if they know.

- Show you a peace sign if they are feeling cool.

## 5. Instructor Do: Feature Prioritization (15 min)

Ask: *How do we decide what features or experiences stay and what gets cut or postponed?*

Feature Prioritization:

- **Feature prioritization** is how designers and product managers decide what should be built when.

  - This is based on what will bring the most value to the user, as well as what is feasible.

  - Features are expensive (hence tech salaries).

Product/Market Fit:

- **Product/market fit** is the degree to which a product satisfies a strong market demand (aka makes money).

  - This is always the goal of a company.

Scope Creep:

- **Scope creep** is what happens when you ignore feature prioritization and product market fit.

  - This is the death of projects.

3 Main Criteria for Prioritizing Features:

- Feasibility is a technical consideration and will need the inputs of the technical team members.

- Desirability is the customer-experience focused part of the analysis.

- Viability of the work needs to be considered as a function of the overall business.

How to Prioritize Features:

1. Create a 2-by-2 matrix with Priorities and Impact as your x and y axes.

2. Write your favorite 8-10 ideas on sticky notes.

3. Arrange sticky notes by priority and impact, factoring in your user persona.

## 6. Student Do: Feature Prioritization Matrix Activity (15 min)

It's time to prioritize the feature ideas you generated during the previous ideation activity.

Slack students the following file:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xXPszh1813nvO9_MLrDCBT1v28zCP8vYw2J6kx-LsS4

Instructions:

1. Create a 2-by-2 matrix in your real-time board.

    ![Feature Prioritization Matrix](Images/Feature-Prioritization.png)

2. Label the following four quadrants:

    - Top left: high priority, low impact

    - Bottom left: low priority, low impact

    - Top right: high priority, high impact

    - Bottom right: low priority, high impact

3. Reuse the What If sticky notes generated during the What If, I Like, I Wish activity.

4. Identify where each sticky note belongs in the four quadrants of your matrix.

5. Take a photo of your work.

## 7. Instructor Do: Feature Matrix Review (10 min)

Get students' attention and let them know time is up. Review the activity by asking some of the following questions:

- Who identified one main idea/feature?

- Who identified two main ideas/features?

- Who identified more than two?

  - Have a TA check in with these students to help clarify the feature matrix, before they begin the next activity. 

- Now that you have an idea what would you do next?

Now let's take a break. When we come back, we'll discuss how to tell the story about your key features.

## 8. Break (10 min)

Have a nice break!

## 9. Instructor Do: Business Value of UX (15 min) 

Now that we know who our user is, let's talk about our business.

What do all successful businesses have in common? **They cater to their users**.

Delivering a top-notch user experience is about more than effective product design — it’s good business.

User Research Drives Business:

- Often cited by UX evangelists, Tom Gilb’s research in the late 80s found that every dollar a company invests in UX can yield a return of up to $100.

- If you build something that’s nice to use, more people will want to use it — and keep using it.

- When it comes to UX, the focus is often on the usability of a website or an app for users. However, UX design is not only about improving the usability, but also to **encourage user behavior that will drive business success**.

- As part of our research process, we have to be able to look out at the industry and determine whom might we be competing against.

Competitive Analysis:

- Is a standard practice in business to identify competitors in the marketplace.

- In terms of UX, it is used to evaluate:

  - What features competitors have.

  - Strengths and weaknesses.

  - The usability and overall user experience.

Reasons to Conduct Competitive Analysis:

- To find inspiration in other people’s success.

- To find opportunity in other people’s design faults.

2 Main Types of Competition:

- Direct competition: Businesses are competing for the same potential market. Example: Uber vs. Lyft.

- Indirect competition: Conflict between vendors whose products or services are not the same but that could satisfy the same consumer need. Example: Uber vs. Driving your own car (car manufacturers)

There are 2 Popular Methods for Conducting Competitive Analysis:

1. Plus/Delta Model: This is the simplest way — a pro/con list. Pluses are features that are working, deltas are opportunities for improvement. 

2. Feature Inventory: Tracks a list of features available across all your competitors, as a way to compare features, identify gaps in the competition or yourself and help you prioritize features.

**How to perform a Competitor Analysis.**

Let’s say we work at USAA on car insurance quote UX team. We want to evaluate the competition.

1. We would identify our competitors and take screenshots as we analyze their product.

2. We would evaluate and annotate things they do well or do poorly. 

3. Then we turn our notes into a detailed deliverable.

## 10. Student Do: Competitor Analysis (15 min)

Let's perform a competitor analysis. This is an activity where students get into groups of 4 and execute on a competitor analysis. 

Slack students the following file and read through the instructions with them:

- https://drive.google.com/open?id=1F8pMOAP_pCiqPjF9lTpoT1t-Jx8Low69rQivTc-FKds

In Step 3 of this activity, students will need th Competitor Analysis Template. Slack them the following: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14UTBhaTMsr5erMcgSvGeClK-pC79Sb57MW6_GSYoFOw/edit#gid=1229686124

## 11. Instructor Do: Review (10 min)

Call the class back to attention and hold critique.

- Ask the students to post their competitor analysis in slack.

- Choose a file from Slack and open it.

- Ask the student to walk you through the competitor analysis.

- Provide your feedback:

  - What is one thing you like about this?

  - What is one thing you would do differently?

- If you have time....open a new competitor analysis and repeat the feedback steps.

## 12. Instructor Do: Business Model Canvas & Value Proposition Statements (10 min)

Part of business research means learning about how businesses create value.

The Business Model Canvas is a strategic management and lean startup template for developing new or documenting existing business models. It is used to describe, design, challenge and pivot a business model. By using it, you can better understand a customer’s business model so designers or product managers can develop better value propositions.

**Value Propositions**: One sentence description of what benefits a product or service provides for whom and how. They are reasons a user chooses one product over another. They matter because:

- If you are unable to communicate a product's value to customers, why should customers place value in what you offer?

- If you are unable to tell customers why they should choose you and why they should pay you what you are asking, why would they?

**How to Create A Value Proposition.**

Answer 4 questions:

1. What do you do?

2. Who is it for?

3. How will your product change their life?

4. What makes you unique?

A few examples of Value Propositions:

- Facebook – “Facebook helps you connect and share with the people in your life.”

- Netflix – “Watch TV programs and films anytime, anywhere.”

- PayPal – “The simpler, safer way to get paid.”

- Reddit – “The front page of the internet.”

## 13. Student Do: Value Proposition Statement (25 min)

Let's practice creating a value proposition statement for Airbnb.com. Students will get into groups of 4 and take 25 minutes to do a value proposition statement. 

Slack students the following link and read through the instructions with students:

- https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lGxR_SPvx4sFNTfdkzceb9DHkuCDTgqojO3RuFNsX5U

## 14. Instructor Do: Review (10 min)

**Try to review every group's value proposition**

Call the class back to attention and hold critique. 

- Ask the students to post their value proposition statement in slack.

- Choose a file from slack and open it.

- Ask a student:

  - What is one thing you like about this?

  - What is one thing you would do differently?

- Ask a TA:

  - What is one thing you like about this?

  - What is one thing you would do differently?

- Provide your feedback:

  - What is one thing you like about this?

  - What is one thing you would do differently?

- If you have time....open another file and repeat the feedback steps.

### 15. Instructor Do: Recap and End Class (1 min)

End class and wish everyone a good night.

Remind students that office hours will be held for the next 30 minutes. If anyone needs help on homework, now is the time.
