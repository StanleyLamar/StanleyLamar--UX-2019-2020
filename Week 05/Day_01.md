- Form groups and generate ideas.

- Create a proto-persona.

- Draft an interview plan.

- Define a hypothesis statement.

- Set up a survey using Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, or Google Forms.

- Give constructive feedback on interview plans.

- Submit a project proposal.

## Class-At-A-Glance

- First off, welcome to Project One! This is the students' first group project. This project develops the students' ability to execute the design thinking process through mobile consumer app product design.

- Today is divided into two parts:
    1. The first involves introducing the project, placing students into groups, generating ideas, and setting up a Trello board.
    2. The second part is a work session where students get started executing the deliverables that are due in the next class.

## Preparing For Class

- Review the lecture slides: [05-07-Group-Project-1/01-Slides/05.1-Welcome to Group Project One Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dEMGq_TttmL7UtGxDRshA7GuQ4t1KXzdry4fKpTxzFc)

- Students will often ask what they do next during this project. Please refer students to the [05-07-Group-Project-1/02-Activities/05.1-Group-Project-1-Guidelines Google Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10SA5f3sCoxAy8rfZsB8ypze1c-4u3ALuK8du8Ak4r4Y).

- **Important**: Students need to be placed into groups of three (or two, depending on class size) during this project.

  - We want to ease the burden of facilitating all your student groups. Assign a few groups to each TA or Instructor for guidance. Next class, we will introduce daily scrums, where groups will check in with their assigned Instructor or TA. Think of it kind of like the TV Show the Voice for design projects.

1. To save time, organize students into groups of three:

    - [Download a copy of the Project One Group Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p7lnWB-OQu-J6FdaBGmp10nCCkVw-kAzyJ6jx12FuqY/edit?usp=sharing) to facilitate assigning students to groups.

    - Upload this document to your class Google Drive.

    - If your class does not divide neatly into groups of three, you will need to adjust the groupings to account for a student pair or two.

    ![Overview](Images/groups-01.png)

2. To keep students on track, divide the number of groups between the instructional staff.

   - These will be the primary groups you will workshop with during each class session.

   - The lead instructor and TAs should also float between groups to provide feedback.

   - Sometimes feedback from different instructors conflicts and it confuses students. Reassure students this happens in the workplace. Everyone has their own perspective. It's the students' job to take all of that feedback and use it to inform their decisions.

    ![Overview](Images/groups-02.png)

- **Main Goal:** This design challenge is the capstone of the UX portion of the curriculum. Your primary focus will be on shepherding students through the design process. You and your instructional staff will act as mentors and project managers to your young designers.

- **Put on Your Coach Hat:** Put on Your Coach’s Hat: Students may not finish all of their deliverables on schedule. Sometimes students will fall behind. When this happens, you will need to use your coaching skills to encourage students to complete their deliverables. You can help them by encouraging students to execute and by providing positive feedback and constructive suggestions. Let them know they are doing great work so that they feel they are on track for success.

  - [How to be a Great Coach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjqYGkNh5KA)

- **Remember:**

    1. By the end of the day, students should submit a project proposal to be approved by the Instructor and/or TAs.

    2. Instructors and TAs should not be standing around or sitting at their computers. You all should be engaging with students throughout the entire day.

- At your discretion, you and the TAs may want to implement a "workshop" series with individual groups.

  - In these workshops, student groups will rotate between the Instructor and TAs to get help on specific tasks. These workshops should be between 10-20 minutes each and are intended to ensure students are heading in the right direction.

  - *Note:* This approach works best if you can physically remove students from the primary classroom and find small spaces to work with individual groups. Be creative here!

- Be sure to take some time to review a few of the student project examples in class. Students enjoy seeing where the bar is set, and it lets them know what is expected.

## Class Materials

- Post-it notes.
  - 3 colors.
- Sharpie pens.
- Pencils.
- Large Paper (22x36).
- Whiteboard + Dry-erase markers.
- Computers, Cameras, or Smartphones for Recording.

## Class Video

- Watch a [Sample Video](https://codingbootcamp.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=b85d388c-0b5c-4cad-923f-aa6b01733195) of this class being taught by Hannah Patellis.

## Time Tracker

- Keep track of the clock. Have TAs consult the [TimeTracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jcNhXM6Mb2aWCzlRMel2f1rhs1PEodwnuF-A5ocNaww/edit?usp=sharing).

## 1. Instructor Do: Welcome (1 min)

Welcome students to class and open the [05-07-Group-Project-1/01-Slides/05.1-Welcome to Group Project One Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dEMGq_TttmL7UtGxDRshA7GuQ4t1KXzdry4fKpTxzFc).

## 2. Instructor Do: Welcome to Project One! (25 min)

Students spent the last four weeks learning some key skills about the UX design process. Now it is time for them to apply all of those skills to an independent studio project.

**Introduce Group Project One:** This project is a great portfolio piece. Students get to design a mobile app that solves a real need in a human’s day-to-day life.

- Students will be working in groups of two to three during this project. Students work in groups because designers work in teams in the real world. You don’t get to choose your coworkers! Soft skills are a critical design skillset.

To start the project, we will be pitching ideas and then attempting to validate those ideas through user and market research.

**Studio model:** This is a Studio Class. Design Studios are fast-paced and oriented towards hands-on exploration. It will feel different from traditional classes.

**The Mission**: Design a mobile app that solves a real need in a human’s day-to-day life. This is the students' first Design Challenge. Students will work in groups of two or three as they research, design, and test a mobile app.

- Each team will collaborate on UX/UI Deliverables in and out of class. This class is dedicated to work time and split into workshop sessions.

**Project One Deliverables & Requirements:** This is a three-week project.

- In week one, students should be executing on user research, synthesis of their qualitative data, the definition of the problem, and ideation.

- In week two, students should be prototyping, testing, and iterating.

- In week three, students will ideally complete the second round of user testing, create a presentation, and then present on the last two days of class.

**Slack out and Review** the [Group Project One Requirements](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10SA5f3sCoxAy8rfZsB8ypze1c-4u3ALuK8du8Ak4r4Y).

**Student Examples:** Review some of the student examples.

If you work hard and execute, you will create a fantastic case study for your design portfolio! Let's look at some former groups that did excellent work.

- [Opportune](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Lg7PAWeXu-MR9Cf2VdybdMK64xxMfTUDFSgst_h-K48/edit?usp=sharing) was created for people to discover virtual micro-volunteer opportunities.

- [Spin](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qPgGwRHayNqgGqT2MjU1UN7kersLo7oPuhPGgEOmBow/edit?usp=sharing) was created to make group decisions easier.

- [Expanding Headspace](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wwa735krwWp8oVZ0qp5vcywt4wSK86ChE7vgiQm0tPE/edit?usp=sharing) designed new features for the Headspace app.

**What makes a good teammate?**

Successful Teamwork requires:

- Making teamwork a priority.

- Clarifying roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities. For a team to succeed, each member should know what their role/responsibility is in the group, and what the roles/responsibilities of others are.

- Setting clear goals. A team that has specific goals and completion deadlines for tasks will work together more effectively than a team without goals.

- Communicating with each other. Team members need to be able to communicate their thoughts, opinions, ideas, and feelings clearly and openly, positively, and respectfully. Everyone should also listen to each other and ask questions for clarification purposes.

- Making decisions together. Making decisions should be based on open dialogue with all members offering their ideas and solutions to problems.

- Building trust and getting to know each other better. Trust can be gained through each team member, demonstrating their accountability for work that’s assigned to them.

- Celebrating differences/diversity. It is essential to view team members as unique individuals and to concentrate on the positive attributes of each member.

- Examining and improving teamwork processes and practices. A team should be able to discuss team norms and what is stopping them from moving forward and progressing.

## 3. Student Do: Pitch Ideas (20 min)

It's time to pitch ideas for your projects!

You have 10 minutes to come up with 3-5 ideas for mobile apps.

Instructions:

1. Take out sticky notes.

2. Write your three app ideas on a single sticky note.

    - Write your ideas legibly; we will be voting on these as a class.

3. When finished, place them on the whiteboard or wall.

## 4. Everyone Do: Review (5 min)

Call the class back to attention.

## 5. Everyone Do: Vote Ideas (20 min)

Instructors should vote on their favorite ideas.

Or have students vote as well.

Use dots on the whiteboard.

## 6. Instructor Do: Review Project Management (5 min)

Call the class back to attention.

- Before we get started, let's talk a little bit about project management.

## 7. Instructor Do: Kanban 101 (15 min)

It's time to introduce students to project management through Kanban boards.

Kanban boards:

- Encapsulate a project or workflow.

- Are what traditional project management tools call a "project" or "workspace."

- Are visual tools that depict work at various stages of a process.

- Include lists that organize Kanban cards into workflows.

Kanban List:

- A list or lane contains a set of related cards—typically those in the same stage of a process—in a titled column on a Kanban board

- A traditional project management tool calls this a "to-do list" or "task list."

Kanban Card:

- A card houses an item related to your board and list, such as a task or product, and lives in a list on a board.

- A traditional project management tool calls this a "to-do" or "task."

Moving cards between columns:

- This is critical to making the most of a Kanban board.

- You'll move existing cards more than you make new ones.

Review the student example.

## 8. Instructor Do: Trello Kanban Demo (10 min)

Review the [Trello Board Demo](https://trello.com/invite/b/IsZVl2Qs/695511affb1c4bbbc4d4f15a9d5a1828/project-1-demo).

9. Slack out a link to the Trello board and have students each create a list.

    - Click: 'Create link'

    ![kaban demo](Images/11-kanban.png)

- By the end of the day, students will submit a link to their project proposal on this project one board.

- IF YOU DON'T WANT TO USE TRELLO: Have students submit project proposals to a Google drive folder.

## 9. Student Do: Trello Setup (15 min)

It's time for students to set up their own Kanban board. Students will be creating a new board, four lists, and cards for the tasks they want to accomplish over the next three weeks.


## 10. Break (10 min-Weekday)/(45 min-Saturday)

Break time! Take 10 minutes (Weekday)/ 45 minutes (Saturday) and relax.

## 11. Student Do: Work Session (60 min)

**Important**: Leave the  Group Project One Requirements slide up on the screen for students to reference.

![Overview](Images/slide.png)

**Project One proposal.**

Have TAs slack out a link the [05-07-Group-Project-1/02-Activities/05.1/05.1-01-Group Project One Proposal Instructions Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11fxGYH31ojclpdwaEpeoZgW3ybY4y95XxDPtLmgpeV0/edit#) and review it with students, if needed.

**Interview Plans.**

- Students often get stuck when writing interview plans. Spend time helping students think about what they want to learn.

- Refer students back to the [User Interview Sample Questions](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vDn65WqjnsoMYG4LWIM18ZaivWR1dHjKVAB72FAFxm8).

Say: **You will want to send out your survey and conduct user interviews after class and for homework. You will need that data for the next class.**

**How to Help Students Get Unstuck.**

Successful problem-solving involves being “stuck.” If students are not getting stuck, then the problems they’re trying to solve aren’t interesting enough.

Good problem solvers have routines for finding new things to try and getting back on track when they’re stuck.

**Some facilitating questions**:

- Can you walk me through your process?
- What is going on in this problem?
- Who is your user?
- What can you try?
- What does this remind you of?
- Why isn’t this working?
- What are you missing?
- Do you need more ideas?
- Do you need help?
- Did you consider x?

**SCENARIO: Coaching and Questioning.**

Use the Socratic method. When students ask questions, the instructor’s response should also be a question. One advantage of question-asking over telling is that we are in a better position to monitor students’ learning when they are doing the talking and explaining.

Scenario A: Process facilitation:

- Student: “I don’t know what to do.”
- Instructor/TAs: “What do you think you should do?”
- Student: “I should do x.”
- Instructor/TAs: “What steps would you take to do x?”

Scenario B: Execution facilitation:

- Student: “Is x correct?”
- Instructor/TA: “Tell me why you think x is correct.”
- Student: “I think it is correct because of a + b + c …”
- Instructor/TA: Did you consider x, y, z?

Encourage them to set up an internal dialogue in which they continually ask themselves:

- “What do I know?”
- “What do I need to know?”
- “What techniques do I have for bridging the gap?”

On numerous occasions, students have come for extra help because they were stuck on a multi-step problem.

- After showing their first step, they froze.
- A facilitator asked them, “Okay, what do you do next?”
- They did one more step and, once more, stopped.
- After repeating the question, they did one more step until the problem was solved.

Students will think you were helpful, but point out that all you did was prompt them to continue. Encourage students to take over that job themselves, and then reminded them that they should not allow uncertainty to lead to paralysis.

- Make something, then analyze it, and iterate.

## 12. Recap and End Class (1 min)

- This wraps up day one of the project week! We are well on our way!

- Take questions.

- Wish everyone a good night.

- Remember, office hours are for the next 30 minutes after class.
